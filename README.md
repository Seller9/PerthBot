# Perth Bot
A Discord bot based about Perth, Western Australia.

A fun little project I am developing to entertain my friends :)

Currently rewriting the code. Please come back soon!

# How to Run
This section will be updated once the rewrite is complete.

The bot will attempt to get an internet connection before running the bot.

# Who, What, When, Where, and Why?
You can also find this information by using the =info command.

### What is this bot?
This bot likes to say Perth and Oil a lot. There is no reasoning behind this except that it is for the meme and the meme only (for some reason). 

### Who made this bot?
The work goes to Seller9 and friends who have helped enhance and enourage development of Perth Bot. The credits below are more specific about this.

### Why Perth?
We love Perth, don't we?

The joke starts out at my friend's house, somewhere south of Perth, Western Australia in the middle of absolute nowhere. We just finished playing Super Smash Bros. on the Switch, and we were figuring out what to play. Up on the list of games comes Broforce. Ooh, exciting.

So fast forward a bit and up comes the world map and our helicopter used to navigate the map. As we figure out where to go next, one of us moves the helicopter over... you guessed it, Perth.

So now, flying over Perth, we all start saying "Perth" over and over again. We keep saying Perth while playing the game, until one of us finds oil. And we love oil too, so here we are, all saying "Oil" as much as we did "Perth".

And that is the story of "Why Perth?".

Thank you to those who have helped improve the bot, provided suggestions, and have encouraged me to work on this project.
