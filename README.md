# Perth Bot
A Discord bot based about Perth, Western Australia.

A fun little project I am developing to entertain my friends :)

Currently Perth Bot has not been uploaded to this GitHub repository yet, I am currently more focused on developing the bot before I start my first upload. I also cannot be bothered removing specific parts of Perth Bot right now, such as the tokens and data in the database tables.

# How to Run
To run this, open PerthBot.py and watch the results!

You will need to add values to the env file, such as bot tokens for accessing the APIs, so don't forget them before running the bot or it will not work. Please also leave a blank line at the end of the file (just press enter on the last line, if there is not already a blank line) or it will have problems reading the file. I will fix this one day, just not now.

Have fun!

### What is this bot?
This bot likes to say Perth and Oil a lot. There is no reasoning behind this except that it is for the meme and the meme only (for some reason).

### Who made this bot?
The work goes to Seller9 and friends who have helped enhance and enourage development of Perth Bot. The credits below are more specific about this.

### Why Perth?
We love Perth, don't we?

The joke starts out at my friend's house, somewhere south of Perth, Western Australia in the middle of absolute nowhere. We just finished playing Super Smash Bros. on the Switch, and we were figuring out what to play. Up on the list of games comes Broforce. Ooh, exciting.

So fast forward a bit and up comes the world map and our helicopter used to navigate the map. As we figure out where to go next, one of us moves the helicopter over... you guessed it, Perth.

So now, flying over Perth, we all start saying "Perth" over and over again. We keep saying Perth while playing the game, until one of us finds oil. And we love oil too, so here we are, all saying "Oil" as much as we did "Perth".

And that is the story of "Why Perth?".
